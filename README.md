### Description

A little container I wrote to automate my [Borgbackup](https://github.com/borgbackup)'s using the excellent [Borgmatic](https://github.com/witten/borgmatic).

This image comes in the three flavours:
1. [base](./base/README.md) (vanilla), with docker log
2. [msmtp](./msmtp/README.md), with e-mail notification
3. [ntfy](./ntfy/README.md), with push notifications

For general instuctions, see the [base](./base/README.md)

### Usage
General instructions can be found from the base image [README](./base/README.md).
